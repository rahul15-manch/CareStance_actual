CareStance — Intern Onboarding Guide

Welcome! This repository contains CareStance, an AI-powered career assessment and guidance platform built with FastAPI and Jinja2 templates. This README is tailored for interns: quick setup, where to start, common tasks, and how to contribute.

---

## Quick Start (Windows)

1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Yuvneet22/CareStance.git
cd CareStance
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Copy the example environment file and set secrets:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys (see Environment Variables section below)
```

3. Run the application locally:

```powershell
python run.py
# App: http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

If using WSL/Unix, use `source .venv/bin/activate` instead of the PowerShell activate command.

## Environment Variables (required for local dev)

- GEMINI_API_KEY — Google Gemini API key (optional for some flows)
- GROQ_API_KEY — Groq (fallback LLM) API key (optional)
- RAZORPAY_KEY_ID — Razorpay test key id (payments)
- RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET — Razorpay test key secret
- ADMIN_EMAIL — Default admin email for notifications
- SECRET_KEY — FastAPI secret for sessions/cookies
- REDIS_URL — Redis connection string (if using caching/session store)

Place these in `.env` at the project root. For interns, it's OK to run without AI keys — some features will be disabled or use mock behavior.

---

## Where to Start (for interns)

- App entrypoint: `app/main.py` — sets up the FastAPI app and routes.
- Core routes: `app/routes/` — look at `payments.py` and other route modules.
- Services: `app/services/` — integration code (e.g., `razorpay_service.py`).
- Database and models: `app/database.py` and `app/models.py` — SQLAlchemy setup and ORM models.
- Templates: `app/templates/` — Jinja2 HTML templates.
- Static assets: `app/static/` — CSS, JS, images, uploads.
- Utility scripts: `scripts/` — useful maintenance and migration helpers.

Recommended first tasks for interns:
- Fix small template bugs in `app/templates/` and preview changes by running locally.
- Add unit tests for a single route or utility in `tests/`.
- Improve documentation for a small module (e.g., `app/services/razorpay_service.py`).

## Common Commands

Activate venv (PowerShell):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

```powershell
python run.py
```

Run a single script (example):

```powershell
python scripts/list_users.py
```

Run tests (if any):

```powershell
pytest -q
```

---

## Project Structure (short)

- `app/` — application code (routes, services, templates, models)
- `scripts/` — maintenance scripts (migrations, seeds, verification)
- `data/` — static question sets and other data used by assessments
- `archive/` — legacy helpers and old migration files (do not change)
- `run.py` — simple runner for local development
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

See the full tree in the repo for more files.

## Development Guidelines (for interns)

- Branches: create feature branches: `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
- Commit messages: short, present tense. Example: "Add unit tests for appointment model".
- Pull Requests: target `main` (or `develop` if present). Include a short description and testing steps.
- Tests: add tests for your changes where practical. Keep changes focused and small.
- Secrets: Never commit API keys or `.env` files.

Code style:
- Use clear function names and avoid single-letter variables.
- Keep functions small (single responsibility).

---

## Useful Scripts

- `python scripts/list_users.py` — list users in DB
- `python scripts/manage_test_data.py` — seed or clear test data
- `python scripts/verify_classification.py` — debug LLM classification outputs

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the server fails to start, inspect `server.log` for stack traces.
- If missing packages: run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- If you see migration or DB issues, check `carestance.db` and `db_schema.txt`.

## How to Contribute

Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contribution workflow, PR checklist, and coding standards. Small, well-documented PRs are preferred for interns.

---

## Where to Ask Questions

- Add comments to your PR describing what you changed and why.
- Tag the mentor or repository owner in the PR (or create an issue if unsure).
